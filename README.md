First attempt at GitHub repository 

My name is Angela, and Kvinne is a handle I use, which is a Scandinavian word and it is NOT pronounced 'k-vinny'. It's 'Kvi-nah'. 

This is kind of fun. I like discovering new worlds and old ones. I am a historian who wants to use data visualization to map the future from the past.
